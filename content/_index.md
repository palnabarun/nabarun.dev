Hi! I'm Nabarun Pal ([he/him][pronoun]) and I love to tinker with software and hobbyist hardware.

Currently, I work an Open Source Engineer at [VMware][vmware-tanzu] where I contribute to Kubernetes and focus on stability of the project. I have led the Kubernetes 1.22 Release Team and been with the release team since Kubernetes 1.17.

You can see me lurking around several open source communities in my free time, notable [Kubernetes][kubernetes] and [Python India][pythonindia] :sunflower:. I an a keen reader of blogs, books and a few subreddits.

Previously, I have worked as an Infrastructure Engineer at early stage startups like [Clarisights][clarisights] and [Algoshelf/Rorodata][algoshelf] where designed and built software for data pipelines, database abstractions, infrastructure management.

I majored in Materials Science along with a minor in Computer Science from [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee][iitr] and I used to hack around electronics and robotics during my time there.

My GPG fingerprint is [5766 AE48 2884 5256 325B DA6E 611D 5079 D826 B150][keybase].
