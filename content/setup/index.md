My main workstation are a Macbook Pro 16" for my Open Source and Personal work and a Macbook Pro 14" for my dayjob related activities. Both are based on the M1 Pro chipset from 2021. I also have [a PC at home which I almost solely use for gaming](/setup/gaming).

My primary mobile computing device is a iPhone 12 and a iPhone 15 for dayjob related activities. I also own an iPhone 15 Pro Max which was my primary phone until I accidently dropped it. :( I carry an old OnePlus 6T on [my backpacking trips](/trips) to have support for networks which don't provide an eSIM.

I own an iPad Pro 11" M2 for reading and consuming video content on the go and while I am travelling. For listening to music, I prefer either my Sony WH-1000XM5 or Apple Airpods Pro Gen 2.

I am also [a mechanical keyboard junkie](/setup/keyboards) and own multiple keyboards which I built/assembled on my own. Currently I am using a Monsgeek M1 with ePBT Kavala keycaps and Boba U4T switches at home and a Ikki68 Aurora R2 with Glorious Panda switches and some random keycaps at office.
