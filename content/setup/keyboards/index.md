title: Keyboards

I have quite a few mechanical keyboards. Only two of them are pre-built keyboards but have hot swap switch sockets.

Currently I use a Monsgeek M1 and Ikki68 Aurora R2 as my primary keyboards. Former is at home, latter  is at my office.

## TODO

- Add a component list
- Add more details of currently built configuration
- Add photos of builds
