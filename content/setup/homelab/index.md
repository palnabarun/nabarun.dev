title: Homelab
---

Currently I am prototyping all Homelab services on a Raspberry Pi 3 and playing around with NixOS for configuration management. Plan is to run a few services behind a Tailscale network and expose all services internally to the Tailscale network and some public facing services on the web.

## TODO

- Learn NixOS.
- Buy cheap commodity hardware to run computer nodes for fun
- Build a mini-ITX or similar form factor PC with decent enough compute and high amounts of storage
- Run services to enhance life
- Run backup services
