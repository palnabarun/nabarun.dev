I want to spend more time in 2022 to "Do Less!", take things as they come, take breaks and try to travel or work on mechanical keyboards during those breaks. The time off that I took in 2021 - first half of August and last half of December, gave me a lot of breathing space and time to rethink priorities especially the first one where I partially overcame burnout due to several factors (Thanks to VMware for the generous leaves!).

Last year, I started actively taking care of my health. I jogged for ~700kms in the last quarter (Oct-Dec) although I did not jog during the time I was travelling to Bangalore/Delhi/Kolkata. I want to continue the same trend and target atleast 3000kms of jogging and a 10km run in 2022.

2021 was also when I moved back to my hometown, Agartala, and that too after a span of 9 years. I spent a lot of time with close family members and friends from school. I plan to spend more time with people who I care about and who care about me, be it in Bangalore or Agartala.
