Over time, I have learnt a lot from the open-source software community, not just in India but from various parts of the world. I have the privilege of learning from the best software engineers in this world. A lot of great mentors have influenced me and helped me in shaping my way into OSS. These interactions were valuable to me, being a self-taught software engineer.

While talking to one junior from my alma mater, I realized there is still a gap between people wanting to get mentored and good mentors in the OSS community. There are outstanding programs like [DGPLUG Summer Training](//foss.training) which help new contributors learn how to survive in the open-source community by covering in breadth the mechanics. Still, people usually don't discover on their own. I understand how frustrating it is to get stuck when you are exploring something. Having a mentor/partner with whom you can discuss doubts is vital in that situation.

As a way of giving back to the community that I have learned so much from, I am pledging 4 hours per week of my time to talk with folks who seek mentorship in OSS, Career journey, or, in general, talk about anything common interests.
